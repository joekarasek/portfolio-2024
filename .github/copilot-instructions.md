# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Welcome to the personal blog and portfolio site for a design engineer. This project is built with Docusaurus and uses TypeScript, React, and SCSS.

## General Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and structure.
- Use TypeScript for all new components and logic.
- Use SCSS for styling; keep styles modular and scoped to components when possible.
- Prefer functional React components.
- Keep content and configuration files (e.g., markdown, YAML, JSON) well-formatted and human-readable.

## Directory Overview
- `src/` — Main source code (components, pages, sections, theme overrides).
- `blog/` — Blog posts and metadata.
- `projects/` — Portfolio project content.
- `static/` — Static assets (images, avatars, etc.).
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts (Node.js, .mjs).

## Copilot Usage
- Suggest code that matches the project's conventions and file organization.
- When generating new blog posts or project entries, use the existing markdown and YAML formats as templates.
- For configuration changes, ensure compatibility with Docusaurus and existing scripts.
- Avoid suggesting large dependencies unless necessary; prefer lightweight, well-maintained packages.

## Contribution
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.
- Test changes locally before pushing.
- Follow accessibility and responsive design best practices.
