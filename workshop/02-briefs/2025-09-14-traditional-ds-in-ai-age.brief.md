brief:
    goal: "Explain why traditional design system work is crucial for AI-human collaboration"
    thesis: "Traditional design system principles (consistent patterns, clean APIs, logical design language) are more important than ever because they create the context that makes AI tools effective"
    reader_state: "Familiar with design systems; questioning their relevance in AI era"
    takeaways: ["Both humans and AI tools work better with well-structured systems", "Traditional principles enable AI-human more effective collaboration", "Context creation is a key value driver for both AI and humans", "Real performance differences between systems"]
    angle: "Effective systems for humans are not that different from effective systems for AI"
    must_include: ["consistent patterns", "clean APIs", "minimal tech debt", "logical design language", "AI tooling performance", "context creation"]
    must_avoid: ["AI hype", "dismissing traditional work", "vendor-specific solutions"]
    length: 1500
    structure_hint: "intro, problem statement, traditional principles, AI context, real examples, actionable takeaways"
