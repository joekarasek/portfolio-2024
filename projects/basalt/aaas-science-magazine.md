# AAAS Science Magazine - Search and Discovery

## About

I built the article search and discovery interface for the AAAS Science Magazine website.

This was a super exciting project for me, as I both love science and it was my first React project.

The search interface was built from a number of re-usable React components, that was mounted onto the page via a php
template to ingrate with their PHP backend. I initially built the interface using a mock API in Pattern Lab, a
predecessor to Storybook.

## Technologies Used

- React v12
- PHP
- Pattern Lab (PHP Version)
- Mustache templating
