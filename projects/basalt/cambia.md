## About

As a senior front-end developer and developer, I worked on the Cambia Health Solutions design system.

This project involved setting up a next generation proof-of-concept component library using React and Storybook. I was involved in setting up the initial repository structure including tooling, build pipelines, linting, and testing. I also help structure the initial design token system, built an initial five components, and documented everything in Storybook.

Additionally, we built a proof-of-concept authoring system that integrated the new design system with a CMS. The goal was to demonstate how a modular, component based approach to authoring could power a more flexible and rapid content authoring workflow.

## Deliverables

- Initial repository structure for a component library, including tooling, linting, and testing.
- Proof-of-concept design token system.
- Prototype build of an initial five components in Storybook, including documentation on usage.
- A single-page React/Redux app utilizing the new components and the Contenful CMS API to demonstrate a content authoring workflow.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Contentful CMS
- Typescript
- Storybook
