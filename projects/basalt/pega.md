## About

During my time at Basalt, I worked on a number of projects for Pega Systems, including:

- Design System development and maintenance using PHP and Web Components.
- Developing a QA strategic roadmap for the design system team.
- Building an automated testing pipeline, including visual regression testing, and integrating it into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Building a complex, animated, and interactive "User Journey" feature for the Pega marketing website.
- Building a proof-of-concept, web-component overlay editor to allow for real-time editing of animations and interactions.

## Deliverables

### Design System work on Bolt

- Defining data schema and models for UI components to assist in integration, testing, and documentation.
- Build a custom validation engine for Twig, to test component schema against integration data from Drupal.
- Contributed to the development of new UI components.
- Contributed to the writing of technical documentation for the design system, including accessibility guidelines.
- Refactored and restructured the build pipelines to improve performance and reduce build times.

### QA Strategic Roadmap and Automated Pipelines

- Worked with stakeholders to define and prioritize QA requirements.
- Developed and pitched a new model for performing QA on design system features and changes.
- Updated linting and code testing tools and added additional test reporting formats.
- Implemented visual regression testing for all components using Percy.io.
- Implemented automated accessibility testing for all components.
- Built a custom test result reporting page that collected results from multiple testing tools and displayed them in a single dashboard, tied to each pull request.

### User Journey Feature

- Built a complex, animated, and interactive "User Journey" feature for the Pega marketing website. This feature included multiple elements entering view in sequence, and was fully authorable by the content team.
- Due to the complexity of the animations and interactions, and pain points around editing these setting via Drupal, I built a proof-of-concept, web-component overlay editor to allow for real-time editing of animations and interactions using GrapesJS. This feature would allow content authors to edit the props of web components in real-time, then "save" their edits back to the Drupal CMS (instead of making edits in Drupal and waiting for a deployment to see changes).
