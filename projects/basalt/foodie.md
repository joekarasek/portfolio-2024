## About

I had the privilege of being the lead engineer on the Foodie project.

Foodie was a peer-2-peer, cottage kitchen marketplace start-up. It was a platform that allowed home cooks to sell their
food to the public.

As the lead developer on this project, I worked closely with the founder of Foodie to build the platform from the
ground up. This involved multiple phases, including:

- Identifying technical requirements, frameworks, and third-party services
- Outlining a roadmap and timeline as part of contract negotiations
- Building a prototype to validate the concept
- Integrating with payment gateways
- On-going development and maintenance

## Deliverables

- Technical leadership during scoping, feature development, and contract negotiations.
- Project management including client communications, ticket tracking, and reporting.
- Custom front-end application development.
- Integration of payment services using the Stripe API.
- Integration of user account management using Sharetribe.
- Integration of mapping services using Mapbox.
- CI/CD, hosting, and DNS setup.
- Integrated analytics tracking for page views, conversions, and transactions through multiple services including
  Google Analytics, Hubspot, and Facebook Pixel.
- Mentored the senior developer who took over the project after 9 months.
