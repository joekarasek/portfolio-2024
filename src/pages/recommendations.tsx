              Joe is an incredibly strong, knowledgeable, and experienced
              leader.

              The first iteration of the design system was delivered at a record
              pace.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™ve never worked with a lead who is so respected and loved by his
              team.

              Joe&#39;s an invaluable pinch-hitter, and subject matter expert on
              the integration of design systems as well as all things React.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the few people I am truly comfortable handing my own
              projects off to. Joe is a skilled and knowledgeable developer and
              technologist.
            </p>
            <p>
              He&#39;s smart, friendly, capable and easy to work with. I would
              hire him myself for any future team I were building.
